FINDINGS:  LUNGS AND AIRWAYS: The central airway is patent. Imaging of the lung parenchyma is mildly degraded by respiratory motion artifact. There are no suspicious lung nodules. There are no focal consolidations. There is a subtle mosaic pattern of the lung parenchyma in the lower lobes which could represent some air trapping.  PLEURA: The pleural surfaces are normal and there are no effusions.  LYMPH NODES/MEDIASTINUM: No mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy. The esophagus is normal in appearance.  CHEST WALL: Negative   THYROID AND LOWER NECK: Negative  CARDIOVASCULAR: There is no significant enlargement of the heart, thoracic aorta or central pulmonary arteries. There is mild coronary artery calcification. There is no pericardial effusion.   UPPER ABDOMEN: Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrate a markedly cirrhotic liver and splenomegaly, both of which have developed since the prior examination.  MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are no suspicious osseous lesions. '"

TECHNIQUE: Gray scale, color, and pulsed Doppler were done.   FINDINGS: Bilateral external iliac, common femoral, and left popliteal veins as well as origins of the profunda femoris and great saphenous veins are patent on gray scale and color Doppler and are fully compressible throughout their course. No evidence for deep venous thrombosis at the level of the left trifurcation.   Compressibility was not assessed in the right femoral and popliteal veins as well as the left femoral vein and right tibioperoneal trunk. No evidence of occlusive deep venous thrombosis.   There is normal respiratory variability within both external iliac veins. Augmentation to flow was not assessed in the popliteal veins.   The evaluation of the bilateral posterior tibial and peroneal veins in the calf is limited due to limited tolerance to scanning on the right than nonvisualization of the veins on the left.  '"

FINDINGS: There is a small area of restricted diffusion extending craniad from the posterior left basal ganglia into the right posterior periventricular white matter. There is corresponding mild T2 prolongation and minimal magnetic susceptibility. There is no acute intracranial hematoma or mass effect. Additional scattered foci of T2 prolongation in the periventricular subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres is identified, most consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

       "\"PET CT SKULL TO THIGH AREA SUBSEQUENT performed on 8/17/2020 11:48 AM  INDICATION: 61 yo female with malignant mixed mullerian of the corpus uteri and left adnexa, squamous cervical cancer.  3/16/2020, TAH/BSO; in cervix uteri right invasive poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the background of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion CIN3 of cervix, pT1b1Nx; in corpus uteri, left ovarian tissue, omentum, liver, diaphragm, appendix, cul-de-sac, bladder serosa, sigmoid, paracolic gutter, malignant mixed mullerian tumor, pT3aNxM1. Carbo/Taxol.  CA 125, 333 on 3/2/2020, 4 on 6/2/2020, 8 on 8/11/2020.   PMH: 2011, L triple negative breast cancer, surgery, chemotherapy, RT. CA-27-29, 11 on 2/14/2020. Other PMH: Graves' disease with thyroid surgery. Diverticulitis. Never smoker.  Comparison: PET/CT 3/11/2020.  Correlation: CT chest abdomen pelvis June 18, 2020.  TECHNIQUE: Oral contrast was given approximately 60 minutes prior to the CT scan. Approximately 60 minutes following intravenous administration of 9.0 mCi of F-18 FDG, PET/CT scan from the base of the skull to the midthigh was performed using 3D acquisition. Transverse image reconstruction using an iterative algorithm was performed with reoriented tomograms displayed in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. The CT scan was performed at a low dose and without intravenous contrast and therefore is not of diagnostic quality. Patient's serum glucose was 112 mg/dl as per finger stick.  FINDINGS:  SUV reference values: Blood pool SUV max 2.9, mean 2.2 Liver SUV max 4.1, mean 3.0  Head and Neck:  Slightly decreased prominent relatively symmetric tonsillar uptake probably inflammatory. Prominent but nonfocal uptake in the large salivary glands. Minimal amount of nonavid residual thyroid tissue. No nodal uptake above blood pool.  Chest:  Right chest port tip in the right atrium.  No nodal uptake above blood pool. Asymmetric number of nonenlarged nonavid nodes in the axilla, right greater than left, likely result of prior left axillary nodal dissection. Posttreatment changes in the left medial breast minimal nonfocal avidity and minimally avid skin thickening are nonspecific and similar as on the prior study. No suspicious focus in the left internal mammary or supraclavicular region. No suspicious focus in the right breast, internal mammary, or supraclavicular region. Complete metabolic response of previously presuming metastatic right hilar, right 3P, level 7 and 8 and retrocrural nodes.  No hypermetabolic pulmonary nodule, mass, or infiltrate. Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  Abdomen/Pelvis:  No focus above heterogenous liver uptake. Prior metastatic probably predominantly peritoneal liver tumors are no longer seen. New nonfocal elevated splenic uptake is probably reactive. Unremarkable pancreas and gallbladder metabolism. No suspicious focus in the genitourinary organs. Mild bilateral vaginal activity on image 245 is likely a contamination, GYN correlation.  Prominent nonfocal bowel uptake without structural correlate but potentially does limit evaluation for serosal disease. Some ill-defined stranding, but not avid subtle peritoneal disease. Midline nonobstructed small bowel umbilical hernia with associated minimally avid presumably inflammatory changes, although tumor cannot be completely excluded. Similarly, mildly avid right anterior pelvic wall skin lesion, image 233, also favored to be inflammatory. Complete resolution of prior malignant ascites. Complete resolution of extensive peritoneal disease in the abdomen and pelvis.  New indeterminant mildly avid subcentimeter right obturator nodes, SUV max 3.1, image 230. No other nodal uptake above blood pool.   Musculoskeletal:  New moderate to intense nonfocal bone marrow uptake probably reactive but precluding adequate evaluation for focal lesion. \""

      "### Question: Summarize this article: LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported Â£20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest Â» . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.
