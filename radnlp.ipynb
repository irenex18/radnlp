There are no focal consolidations. There is a subtle mosaic pattern of the lung parenchyma in the lower lobes which could represent some air trapping.  PLEURA: The pleural surfaces are normal and there are no effusions.  LYMPH NODES/MEDIASTINUM: No mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy. The esophagus is normal in appearance.  CHEST WALL: Negative   THYROID AND LOWER NECK: Negative  CARDIOVASCULAR: There is no significant enlargement of the heart, thoracic aorta or central pulmonary arteries. There is mild coronary artery calcification. There is no pericardial effusion.   UPPER ABDOMEN: Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrate a markedly cirrhotic liver and splenomegaly, both of which have developed since the prior examination.

       "\"Study: CT CHEST WO IV CONTRAST  Date:  1/19/2018 3:02 PM  History/Indication:  lung nodule, f/u.  Technique:  A volumetric CT acquisition of the chest was obtained from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen without intravenous administration of contrast. Coronal and sagittal reconstructed images are provided.  Comparison: Chest CT from 9/13/2017 and PET CT from 9/29/2017. Chest CT from 4/11/2017 was also reviewed.  FINDINGS:  Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Again seen is pulmonary emphysema predominating the bilateral upper lobes. The subsolid ill-defined nodule in the right lower lobe has not significantly changed in size when measured in a similar fashion (measuring 18 x 12 mm on image 215 of series 3), but it has decreased in density (better appreciated comparing image 55 of series 2 on today's exam with image 51 of series 3 on the most recent prior CT). Internal lucencies are again seen within this nodule, slightly increased from prior exams. Several smaller than 4 mm scattered bilateral lung nodules are unchanged. Subsegmental atelectasis is seen in the bilateral lower lobes. No new consolidations or pulmonary edema. No new discrete suspicious lung nodules. Stable biapical pleural-parenchymal scarring. Central airways are patent and clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinum, Lymph nodes: Evaluation of the mediastinum and hila for adenopathy is suboptimal without intravenous administration of contrast. There are no enlarged mediastinal or hilar nodes by CT criteria.  Heart and Vessels: Cardiac chambers appear stable in size. Decreased attenuation of the blood pool suggests underlying anemia.There is no pericardial effusion. Thoracic aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in caliber.  Upper Abdomen:  Images through the unenhanced upper abdomen reveal a few stable too small to characterize hepatic hypodensities.  Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: Review of the bones reveal no suspicious or aggressive bony lesions. Degenerative changes are seen in the visualized spine. \""

Apparent interval decrease in density may be related to different inspiratory effort, particularly given the basilar location of this nodule, or it may represent partial resolution of an infectious/inflammatory nodule. Therefore, a follow-up chest CT is recommended in 3 months to reassess.'"

       "'CT CHEST W IV CONTRAST  Date: 4/1/2022 11:51 AM  INDICATION: Hematologic malignancy, monitor. Additional history per electronic medical record: T-cell lymphoma, status post prior stem cell transplant.  COMPARISON: 10/23/2021  TECHNIQUE:  A volumetric CT acquisition of the chest was obtained from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen, following the administration of intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reconstructed images are provided.  FINDINGS:  Lungs/Airways/Pleura : There is a new 1 cm groundglass nodule in the paramediastinal left lower lobe (image 365 of series 6). This is nonspecific, could be infectious or inflammatory in etiology, follow-up is recommended to document clearing and to exclude other etiologies. A few scattered less than 4 mm solid lung nodules are unchanged and are also stable when compared with 11/2018, likely benign. Calcified granulomas present.  Mild, multifocal bronchiectasis again noted. Mosaic lung attenuation compatible with air trapping as seen on prior study where there was respiratory motion with several images in expiration. While these findings may be due to to COPD, correlate clinically to exclude bronchiolitis obliterans, which can be seen in the setting of graft-versus-host disease among other etiologies. No significant change in peripheral, basilar predominant fibrotic interstitial lung disease with reticular markings and subpleural cysts/honeycombing with a UIP pattern, however appears new compared with 11/2018. Central airways are patent. No consolidation or pleural effusion.  Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: Stable subcentimeter mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes measuring up to 9 mm in short axis diameter in the subcarinal and right hilar regions. A subcentimeter right supraclavicular lymph node is also unchanged.  Heart and Vessels: Right-sided infusion port present with tip in the SVC. The heart is normal in size. Accessory pulmonary veins are incidentally noted. No pericardial effusion. Mild coronary artery calcification.  Upper Abdomen: Concurrent CT abdomen/pelvis is dictated separately.  Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: Degenerative spine changes present. No aggressive bone lesions. Concurrent neck CT is dictated separately. '"

       " 'MR venogram study without and with intravenous contrast MRI of the brain with and without intravenous contrast enhancement  History : Venous thrombosis, six-month scan look for resolution.  Technique : MR venogram study was performed without and with intravenous contrast. 3D reformatted images were performed. MR of the brain was also performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast.  Findings :  There is partial recanalization of the right transverse and sigmoid sinuses. The right transverse and sigmoid sinuses appear asymmetrically small  in caliber and slightly irregular in contour as compared to the left. The left transverse and sigmoid sinuses are patent. The jugular veins are patent bilaterally.  The superior sagittal sinus, inferior sagittal sinus straight sinus , and torcula  are unremarkable. No filling defects were seen.Major deep cortical draining veins are unremarkable.  Findings were confirmed on 3D reformatted images.   MRI of the brain demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct. There is no evidence of hemorrhage. CSF spaces are within normal limits. The basal cisterns are patent. Flow voids are seen in the skull base on T2 weighted imaging indicating patency of major cerebral vessels. The paranasal sinuses and tympanomastoid spaces are clear. ',\n",
